I personally implemented ~60% of the final code. I resolved a critical security flaw where the login process downloaded , our entire user database to a malicious users device. We used Firebase, which is a cloud computing platform similar to AWS, where we could store our data and host our website. Note that our Firebase is no longer running after our graduation date.",

Users can create accounts and login using a MySQL database and Spring Security. I made a custom animation handling API to decouple the animation from the objects, which decreased development time. The character is animated, can move in the surrounding area, can swing his sword, can jump, and can sprint.",
